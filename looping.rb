# It's your first year at Hogwarts and you're having a 
# tough time getting the hang of that levitation spell. 
# Fill out the content of the method `looping` to contain a `loop` 
# that `puts` the levitation charm `"Wingardium Leviosa"` 
# an infinite number of times. 
# Beneath your method definition, 
# call your method by typing the name of the method, `looping`.
# 3. Then, run the file by typing `ruby looping.rb` 
# in your terminal from the directory of this lab. 
# You'll be stuck in an infinite levitation loop! 
# Hit `Control`+`C` to exit the infinite loop.
